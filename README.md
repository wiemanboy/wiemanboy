# Hi there, I'm Wiemanboy

I'm a web developer studying at HU with a focus on backend development. This is my GitHub profile where I showcase my personal projects and code samples.

I have experience with different backend frameworks for creating REST API's and multiple frontend frameworks. Besides that i am very good at working with git.

I am overall very flexible and always eager to use the latest technology.
