# Hi there, I'm Wiemanboy

I'm a web developer studying at HU with a focus on backend development. I have experience in Java, c# HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. This is my GitHub profile where I showcase my personal projects and code samples.

A short poem about myself:

```
SequenceBoy, SequenceBoy, with code in his veins,
Traversing arrays, with no need for chains.
From algorithm to algorithm he goes,
A maestro of sequences, nobody knows.

He loops through the arrays with precision and grace,
A smile on his face, never losing his pace.
From sorting to searching, his skills never fail,
He's the master of sequences, come rain or hail.

So let us all hail SequenceBoy with pride,
For in his hands, our data will never collide.
He's the guardian of our sequences, the knight of our code,
And with him by our side, we'll never lose our road.
```
